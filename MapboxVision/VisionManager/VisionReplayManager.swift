/**
 `VisionReplayManager` is a counterpart of `VisionManager` that uses recorded video and telemetry instead of realtime data.
 Use it to debug and test functions that use Vision in a development environment before testing in a vehicle.
 Use it in the same workflow as you use `VisionManager` after creating it with specific recorded session.

 Lifecycle of VisionReplayManager :
 1. `create`
 2. `start`
 3. `stop`, then lifecycle may proceed with `destroy` or `start`
 4. `destroy`

 - Important: This class is intended for debugging purposes only.
 Do NOT use session replay in production application.
