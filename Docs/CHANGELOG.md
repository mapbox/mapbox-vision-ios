- Deprecated property `laneVisualParams` in `VisionARViewController`
- Deprecated method `create(visionManager:delegate:)`. You need to create vision AR manager with `create(visionManager:)` and set the delegate as property
- Moved AR rendering to native

### Safety
- Added property `delegate` to `VisionSafetyManager`
- Deprecated method `create(visionManager:delegate:)`. You need to create vision safety manager with `create(visionManager:)` and set the delegate as property
